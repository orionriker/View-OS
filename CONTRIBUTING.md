# Contributing to View OS
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `viewos-main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

# Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v3.0
When you submit changes to the codebase, please note that your submissions are subject to the terms of the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/), which covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/gamemaster123356/View-OS/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
